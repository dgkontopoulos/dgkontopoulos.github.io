### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Organisms have the capacity to alter their physiological response to 
warming through acclimation or adaptation, but the consequence of this 
metabolic plasticity for energy flow through food webs is currently 
unknown, and a generalisable framework does not exist for modelling its 
ecosystem-level effects. Here, using temperature-controlled experiments 
on stream invertebrates from a natural thermal gradient, we show that 
the ability of organisms to raise their metabolic rate following 
chronic exposure to warming decreases with increasing body size. 
Chronic exposure to higher temperatures also increases the acute 
thermal sensitivity of whole-organismal metabolic rate, independent of 
body size. A mathematical model parameterised with these findings shows 
that metabolic plasticity could account for 60% higher ecosystem energy 
flux with just +2°C of warming than a traditional model based on 
ecological metabolic theory. This could explain why long-term warming 
amplifies ecosystem respiration rates through time in recent mesocosm 
experiments, and highlights the need to embed metabolic plasticity in 
predictive models of global warming impacts on ecosystems.
