### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The capacity of arthropod populations to adapt to long-term climatic warming 
is currently uncertain. Here we combine theory and extensive data to show 
that the rate of their thermal adaptation to climatic warming will be 
constrained in two fundamental ways. First, the rate of thermal adaptation of 
an arthropod population is predicted to be limited by changes in the temperatures 
at which the performance of four key life-history traits can peak, in a 
specific order of declining importance: juvenile development, adult 
fecundity, juvenile mortality and adult mortality. Second, directional 
thermal adaptation is constrained due to differences in the temperature of 
the peak performance of these four traits, with these differences expected 
to persist because of energetic allocation and life-history trade-offs. We 
compile a new global dataset of 61 diverse arthropod species which provides 
strong empirical evidence to support these predictions, demonstrating that 
contemporary populations have indeed evolved under these constraints. Our 
results provide a basis for using relatively feasible trait measurements to 
predict the adaptive capacity of diverse arthropod populations to geographic 
temperature gradients, as well as ongoing and future climatic warming.
