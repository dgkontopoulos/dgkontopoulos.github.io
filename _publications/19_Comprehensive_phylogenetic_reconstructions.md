### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Adaptive radiations often occur with an early burst which requires both 
various niches and a generalist ancestor. However, ancestral generalism 
remains hard to test. The New World leaf-nosed bats (family Phyllostomidae) 
represent an adaptive radiation with highly diverse diets including 
arthropods, nectar, and fruits. Ancestral omnivory may have facilitated 
the phyllostomid radiation, but previous estimations supported ancestral 
insectivory. These estimations were limited by single-trait models, 
constrained transitions, and unaccounted phylogenetic uncertainty. To 
address these limitations, we estimated ancestral diets through 
multi-response phylogenetic threshold models using discrete ordered diets 
(141 phyllostomid species) and multivariate Brownian motion models using 
continuous compositional diets (109 phyllostomid species) from published 
datasets, while explicitly accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty using 
published mammalian phylogenies. We infer complementary fruit feeding in 
the phyllostomid common ancestor and at the early burst of their radiation, 
supporting the ancestral omnivory hypothesis. Extending this analysis to 
all bat families (621 species) reveals independently evolved ancestral 
fruit feeding in four families, but only Phyllostomidae and Pteropodidae 
evolved predominant/strict fruit feeding and high species diversity. 
Therefore, our results reveal that ancestral generalism (i.e., omnivory) 
may be a precondition but does not necessarily lead to adaptive radiations 
which also require subsequent niche partitioning.
