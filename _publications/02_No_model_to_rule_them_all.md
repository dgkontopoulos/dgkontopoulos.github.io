### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In ectotherms, the performance of physiological, ecological and life-history 
traits universally increases with temperature to a maximum before decreasing 
again. Identifying the most appropriate thermal performance model for a 
specific trait type has broad applications, from metabolic modelling at 
the cellular level to forecasting the effects of climate change on 
population, ecosystem and disease transmission dynamics. To date, 
numerous mathematical models have been designed, but a thorough 
comparison among them is lacking. In particular, we do not know if 
certain models consistently outperform others and how factors such as 
sampling resolution and trait or organismal identity influence model 
performance. To fill this knowledge gap, we compile 2,739 thermal 
performance datasets from diverse traits and taxa, to which we fit a 
comprehensive set of 83 existing mathematical models. We detect 
remarkable variation in model performance that is not primarily driven 
by sampling resolution, trait type, or taxonomic information. Our 
results reveal a surprising lack of well-defined scenarios in which 
certain models are more appropriate than others. To aid researchers in 
selecting the appropriate set of models for any given dataset or 
research objective, we derive a classification of the 83 models based 
on the average similarity of their fits.
