### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In ectotherms, the performance of physiological, ecological, and life-history 
traits universally increases with temperature to a maximum before decreasing 
again. Identifying the most appropriate thermal performance model for a 
specific trait type has broad applications, from metabolic modelling at 
the cellular level to forecasting the effects of climate change on population, 
ecosystem, and disease transmission dynamics. To date, numerous mathematical 
models have been designed, but a thorough comparison among them is lacking. 
In particular, we do not know if certain models consistently outperform others, 
and how factors such as sampling resolution and trait or organismal identity 
influence model performance. These have led researchers to select models 
semi-arbitrarily, potentially introducing biases that compromise environmental 
suitability predictions. To fill these gaps, we collect 2,739 thermal 
performance datasets from diverse traits and taxa, to which we fit 83 models 
used in previous studies. We detect remarkable variation in model performance 
which is not primarily driven by sampling resolution, trait type, or taxonomic 
information. Our results highlight a lack of well-defined scenarios in which 
certain models are more appropriate than others. Therefore, to avoid likely 
model-specific biases, future studies should perform model selection to 
identify the most appropriate model(s) for their data.
