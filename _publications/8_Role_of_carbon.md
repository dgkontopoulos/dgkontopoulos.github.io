### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Relating the temperature dependence of photosynthetic biomass 
production to underlying metabolic rates in autotrophs is crucial for 
predicting the effects of climatic temperature fluctuations on the 
carbon balance of ecosystems. We present a mathematical model that links 
thermal performance curves (TPCs) of photosynthesis, respiration, and 
carbon allocation efficiency to the exponential growth rate of a 
population of photosynthetic autotroph cells. Using experiments with 
the green alga, <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, we apply the model to show that the 
temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency is key to 
understanding responses of growth rates to warming at both ecological 
and longer-term evolutionary timescales. Finally, we assemble a dataset 
of multiple terrestrial and aquatic autotroph species to show that the 
effects of temperature-dependent carbon allocation efficiency on 
potential growth rate TPCs are expected to be consistent across taxa. 
In particular, both the thermal sensitivity and the optimal temperature 
of growth rates are expected to change significantly due to temperature 
dependence of carbon allocation efficiency alone. Our study provides a 
foundation for understanding how the temperature dependence of carbon 
allocation determines how population growth rates respond to temperature.
