### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>

Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to 
different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the 
face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism's thermal performance 
curve (TPC)—the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature—is 
its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with 
temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, 
the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as 
"activation energy" values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms 
that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about 
the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using 
a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal 
sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria 
and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 
microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We 
find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately 
phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated 
evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, 
we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing 
the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We 
obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the 
thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: 
net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that 
these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing 
forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations 
and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results 
indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in 
thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can 
occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to 
elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal 
sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.
