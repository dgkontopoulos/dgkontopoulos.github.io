### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to 
different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the 
face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism's thermal performance 
curve - the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature - 
is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase 
with temperature within its typically-experienced thermal range. For a 
given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, 
often quantified as "activation energy" values, is typically right-skewed. 
Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, 
with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints vs 
adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we 
study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate 
across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and 
prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), two microbial groups that play a major 
role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across 
these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its 
distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout 
its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive 
evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among 
its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar 
results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of two 
physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and 
respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of 
evolutionary convergence are consistent with two opposing forces: decrease 
in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due 
to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that 
adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal 
sensitivity, especially in microbes where rapid evolution can occur 
at short time scales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to 
elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal 
sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.
