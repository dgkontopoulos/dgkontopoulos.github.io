### Abstract:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Understanding the structural changes that enable enzymes to remain active 
in extreme thermal conditions is of broad scientific interest for both 
fundamental and applied biological research. Three commonly discussed 
mechanisms that underlie the thermal adaptation of enzymes include 
modifications in structural flexibility, compactness, and in the contact 
network among amino acids. However, most previous studies on these topics 
have been limited to small sample sizes or a narrow taxonomic focus, and 
the relative importance of these factors to thermal adaptation remains 
poorly understood. In this study, we combined molecular dynamics 
simulations and phylogenetic comparative analyses to thoroughly analyse 
the structural factors underlying thermal adaptation across 70 prokaryotic 
adenylate kinases, a key enzyme involved in cellular energy balance and 
homeostasis. We detect systematic increases in the flexibility of the 
enzyme with temperature, both across and within species. In contrast, 
structural compactness appears to be almost completely independent of 
temperature. Finally, we detect a remarkable diversity in the contact 
networks of different adenylate kinases that cannot be explained solely 
by temperature. Our results suggest that there are multiple paths toward 
the adaptation of prokaryotic adenylate kinases to extreme thermal 
environments, but such paths generally involve changes in flexibility.
