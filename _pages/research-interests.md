Climate change is among the most important threats to global biodiversity. 
To accurately forecast its impacts on the biosphere, it is important to 
develop a thorough understanding of <b>current and historical responses of diverse biological systems to environmental changes</b>.<br><br>I pursue this by 
working across taxonomic groups (from bacteria and phytoplankton 
to birds and mammals), levels of organization (from molecules to ecosystems), 
timescales (from seconds to hundreds of millions of years), and by leveraging 
a wide array of methods (e.g., ecoinformatics, phylogenetic comparative methods, 
comparative genomics, machine learning).<br><br>
Two major themes of my research to date are the following:</font></p>

In ectotherms, the performance of physiological, ecological, and life-history traits 
(e.g., respiration, consumption rate) is typically a unimodal function of 
temperature. The shape of this relationship exhibits remarkable variation 
across traits, taxa, and environments. To better understand how such variation 
emerges, I perform meta-analyses of large empirical datasets, accounting for 
phylogeny and key environmental factors.

<p style="line-height:2px">&nbsp;</p>Many endotherms have the ability to 
enter dormancy (daily torpor or hibernation) in response to challenging environmental 
conditions (e.g., low food resources, extreme temperatures). To shed light on 
the underlying factors, I am combining approaches from phylogenetic comparative methods, 
ecoinformatics, and comparative genomics.
