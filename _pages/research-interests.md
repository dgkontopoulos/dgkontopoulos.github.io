The various levels of biological organization (e.g., enzymes, organismal 
physiology, ecological communities) are influenced by and 
respond to environmental changes in different ways. My main research goal 
is to understand <b>how such responses vary across species and 
environments</b>, as well as <b>how responses at a given level (e.g., physiology) 
may affect responses at higher levels (e.g., an ecosystem)</b>.<br><br>
Some representative themes of my research are the following:</font></p>

In ectotherms, the performance of physiological rates 
(e.g., respiration, photosynthesis) is typically a unimodal function of 
temperature. The shape of this relationship exhibits remarkable variation 
across traits, individuals, and species. To increase our understanding 
of the processes that introduce variation into the shape of physiological 
responses to temperature, I perform meta-analyses of large empirical 
datasets, accounting for phylogeny and key environmental factors.

<p style="line-height:2px">&nbsp;</p>Species have evolved a range of strategies to persist in their local 
environments. To shed light on the genomic changes that underlie such 
adaptations (e.g., positive selection, gene losses/duplications), I am 
combining approaches from phylogenetic comparative methods, 
eco-informatics, and comparative genomics.
